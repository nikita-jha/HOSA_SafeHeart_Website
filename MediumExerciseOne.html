     <p style="color:black;font-size: 20px; font-family: sans-serif">For people who are not in immediate danger for heart attacks, but their levels still deviate significantly from the normal amount, we suggest that the patient consult a doctor to ensure that a heart attack has not already occured. If it is has occured, they should pursue treatment as prescribed; however, if a heart attack has not occured, we recommend a series of semi-high intensity workouts focused on building a strong cardiovascular system by exercising 45 to 90 minutes a day. These exercises should substantially raise the patinet's heart rate, causing strengthening of the heart and blood vessels and improving the flow of oxygen in the process.  </p>
